Warnings
=========
1. Free don't mean easy.
2. Free means be careful.
3. Lots of bugs means fun times.

Setup
=====
1. Derk recommends you have your chart on the account you want to replicate.
2. Add the indicator to your chart.
3. Set the "Copy from this Account" to the account on your Chart.
4. Set the various Account 1 through 20 to what you want to copy.

Ideas on Using with Strategies
==============================
1. NinjaTrader strategies are notoriously difficult to synchronize with the underlying accounts.
2. So, Derk suggest, you create two to three Sim accounts for each Strategy so you can synchronize the underlying accounts.

TODO
====
1. Prevent Master from being a child/follower.  I think I did this. Deeeerkie?
2. Clear drop down when removing an account. This is a pain point right now. To avoid it create a Sim account with like a million bucks called GarbageMan and just assign it.
3. Instead of showing Master + Label in the Display override show Master and all active/real followers/kiddos
4.
