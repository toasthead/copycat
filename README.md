Copy Cat
=========
Copy Cat - A totes yeah man rotes totes frees as in frees trades copierz!

Warnings
=========
1. Free don't mean easy.
2. Free means be careful.
3. Lots of bugs means fun times.

ALWAYS
======
1.  Always. No matter what.  Add this indicator as a New Panel.  When you add the indicator there is a section called "Visual" and it has a drop down. Use the "Panel" dropdown and select "New Panel". Derk says, "Not on my price panel!".
2.  You will understand in time or you will stand under.

Setup
=====
1. Derk recommends you have your chart on the account you want to replicate.
2. Add the indicator to your chart.
3. Set the "Copy from this Account" to the account on your Chart.
4. Set the various Account 1 through 20 to what you want to copy.

Ideas on Using with Strategies
==============================
1. NinjaTrader strategies are notoriously difficult to synchronize with the underlying accounts.
2. So, Derk suggest, you create two to three Sim accounts for each Strategy so you can synchronize the underlying accounts.
3. I am not going to use the word "Sim" because for some reason NinjaTrader thinks that is mandatory.
4. SimTest1A, SimTest1B, SimTest1C.
5. Now, suppose you have a strategy on a 1m chart called "Bullshit".  You assign that strategy and/or chart to SimTest1A.  I say strategy bcuz you might be a fancy mutherfucker who does strats without charts.
6. Add CopyCat and the Leader Cat is SimTest1A and the follower is SimTest1B and activate it.  Every trade SimTest1A takes will be copied to SimTest1B.
7. Here is where it gets fun.

TODO
====
1. Prevent Master from being a child/follower.  I think I did this. Deeeerkie?
2. Clear drop down when removing an account. This is a pain point right now. To avoid it create a Sim account with like a million bucks called GarbageMan and just assign it.
3. Instead of showing Master + Label in the Display override show Master and all active/real followers/kiddos
4. asdf

BUGZ
====
1. Can't save templates etc... because the account is attached. Blah, blah, blah you will figure this out.
