ALWAYS
======
1.  Always. No matter what.  Add this indicator as a New Panel.  When you add the indicator there is a section called "Visual" and it has a drop down. Use the "Panel" dropdown and select "New Panel". Derk says, "Not on my price panel!".
2.  A cool feature man, is that the Indicator NAME will be the Cat Account you choose but you SHOULD use the text input Label to identify the underlying Kitten accounts.
3.  You will understand in time or you will stand under.

Installation
=============
1. Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrkkkkkkkkkkiiiiiiiieeeeee!
2. Just download it and then use the fucking NT8 import.
3. It is totall free open source so you can open the .cs file in a text editor of your choice like HatePad, Derk means, Notepad and see there is nothing harmful.  Trust us, if we wanted to harm you, you would have already been harmed.

Setup
=====
1. Derk recommends you have your chart on the account you want to replicate.
2. Add the CopyCat indicator to your chart.
3. Set the "Copy from this Account" to the account on your Chart.
4. Set the various Account 1 through 20 to what you want to copy.

Ideas on Using with Strategies
==============================
1. NinjaTrader strategies are notoriously difficult to synchronize with the underlying accounts.
2. So, Derk suggests, you create a minimum of 3 Sim accounts for each Strategy so you can synchronize the underlying accounts.
3. I am not going to use the word "Sim" because for some reason NinjaTrader thinks that is mandatory.
4. SimTest1A, SimTest1B, SimTest1C. I used the werd.  
5. Now, suppose you have a strategy on a 1m chart called "Bullshit".  You assign that strategy and/or chart to SimTest1A account. You add CopyCat with SimTest1A as the Cat (leader).  I say strategy bcuz you might be a fancy mutherfucker who does strats without charts. Still the Cat is the Cat and not a Kitten.
6. Add CopyCat and the Leader Cat is SimTest1A and the follower is SimTest1B and activate it.  Every trade SimTest1A takes will be copied to SimTest1B.
7. Here is where it gets fun.
8. Set up a 2nd chart with SimTest1B as the account.  It doesn't need a strategy.  Add CopyCat with SimTest1B as the Cat and then add your actual personal or prop firm accounts as Kittens.  Now you can either safely synchronize yourself to a running strategy on SimTest1A via SimTest1B or after synchronizing you can easily exit if you want to manually manage the trade.

TODO
====
1. Prevent Master from being a child/follower.  I think I did this. Deeeerkie?
2. Clear drop down when removing an account. This is a pain point right now. To avoid it create a Sim account with like a million bucks called GarbageMan and just assign it.
3. Instead of showing Master + Label in the Display override show Master and all active/real followers/kiddos
4. Farking redo the source code to use the werds Cat and Kitten and not the lame ass shit it does.
5. Active/Inactive boolean for each account in the drop down.
6. Ability to have a different instrument (symbol) for each Kitten.
7. Ability to have different lot sizes per Kitten.
8. Instead of dropdowns make it more like how Quantower does it with Groups.

BUGZ
====
1. Can't save templates etc... because the account is attached. Blah, blah, blah you will figure this out.  See the TODOs mofo!
